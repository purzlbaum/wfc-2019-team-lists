Team lists for the World Floorball Championchips in NeuchÃ¢tel

## Teams

All teamlists are under the folder `Teams`. If you use [Photo Mechanic](https://store.camerabits.com/products/photo-mechanic-6) you can add the files to your code replacements (under settings > code replacements). 

For example. If the Australian Player No. 3 is on your image you just type `/aus3/` in your IPTC field and Photo Mechanic will replace it automatically with `Tiffany Hames (#3, Australia)`.

The first three letters of each file are the equivalent of the shortcut you can use.

## Stationary Pad

There are two files for your stationary pad. One for each arena. Currently all contact information are on my Name, so change it. ;)

Everything else is automated. If you populate the `Supp Cat 1` and `Supp Cat 2` fields with the home and away team, it automatically fills out tags and titles.
